# Smart Contract Dependency Checker

The Smart Contract Dependency Checker is a specialized tool designed to enhance the security posture of blockchain smart contracts. As smart contracts often rely on external libraries or other contracts, ensuring the security of these dependencies is crucial. This tool automates the process of identifying dependencies within a smart contract and checks them against a database of known vulnerabilities, providing developers with a clear picture of potential risks.

## Features

- **Dependency Identification**: Automatically identifies external contract calls or library dependencies in the smart contract code.
- **Vulnerability Check**: Checks the identified dependencies against a database of known vulnerabilities.
- **Risk Reporting**: Provides a detailed report on potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with the dependencies.
- **Recommendations**: Offers actionable recommendations for addressing identified vulnerabilities.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python smart_contract_dependency_checker.py
   ```
3. Input the smart contract code when prompted.
4. Review the generated report for insights and recommendations.
